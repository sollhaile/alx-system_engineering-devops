Secure and Monitored Web Infrastructure Design

Components:
- 3 firewalls
- 1 Load Balancer (HAProxy) with SSL certificate
- 2 Web/Application servers
- 1 MySQL Primary DB and 1 Replica DB
- 3 Monitoring Agents (e.g., Sumologic)

Why use them:
- Firewalls protect each layer (LB, Web, DB) by allowing only specific traffic
- SSL encrypts communication, protecting user data
- Monitoring agents send metrics/logs to track performance and uptime

Monitoring Example:
- To monitor QPS, collect access logs from Nginx or DB logs via agent
- Metrics sent to dashboard tools like Grafana or Sumologic

Issues:
- SSL termination at load balancer means traffic to internal servers is unencrypted
- Single MySQL write server is a SPOF
- Combining all roles (web, app, db) on one server reduces performance and scalability
