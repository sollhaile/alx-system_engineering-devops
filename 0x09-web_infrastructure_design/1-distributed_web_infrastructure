Distributed Web Infrastructure Design

Components:
- 2 Web Servers (Nginx)
- 1 Load Balancer (HAProxy)
- 2 Application Servers
- 1 MySQL Database Cluster (1 Primary + 1 Replica)

How it works:
1. User types www.foobar.com â†’ DNS resolves to Load Balancer IP (8.8.8.8)
2. Load Balancer uses round-robin to distribute traffic to Web Servers.
3. Web Servers forward requests to Application Servers (code logic).
4. Application Servers connect to the Primary database for writes.
5. Read-heavy tasks go to the Replica DB for performance.

Load Balancer:
- HAProxy with Round-Robin algorithm
- Active-Active setup: both web servers serve traffic

Database:
- Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) replication
- Primary handles writes, Replica handles reads

Issues:
- SPOF: Load Balancer
- No security (firewall/HTTPS)
- No monitoring for health checks or alerts
